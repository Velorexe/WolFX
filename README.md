# WolFX
WolFX is a Discord skin for Better Discord. In the repo we'll provide the basic tools (like Bandaged Discord, the installer for Better Discord) and the WolFX theme.
It's usage is quite simple, here's a little tutorial:

1.
  Install Better Discord with the BandagedBD.exe file, run this as administrator.
2.
  Wait for it to install completely (shouldn't take too long).
3.
  When Better Discord is installed, go to your %appdata% folder, then to Roaming -> BetterDiscord -> themes
  Then drag and drop the WolFX.theme.css into this folder.
4.
  Start Discord and head to Settings, there you'll see a "Themes" tab.
5.
  Enable the WolFX skin and you're good to go, the skin should be enabled now.
  
Some frequent problems that can occur:
1. Better Discord did not install properly, there is no themes tab appearing.
  This problem occurs pretty often on installing Better Discord, the BandagedBD should fix that. Be sure to run it as an administrator.
2. The WolFX theme isn't loading, what am I doing wrong?
  Try restarting Discord (this can be done with CTRL + R, this way Discord will be reloaded) and try again.
